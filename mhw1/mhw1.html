            Best Over-Ear Headphones
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless are the best over-ear headphones we've tested. There's a newer version of these headphones available in the Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless, but the previous generation offer better performance for their price. These headphones have an outstanding active noise cancelling (ANC) system that can isolate you from a wide range of ambient noise. Their bass-heavy sound profile also adds thump, rumble, and punch to your audio, making these headphones well-suited for genres like EDM and hip-hop. While mixes sound muddy to some users, their sound can also be customized with a graphic EQ and presets in the companion app.

            These headphones have a premium build quality, a sleek design, and a very comfortable fit. Their roughly 37 hours of continuous playback time will easily last through long days on the go. They also support multi-device pairing, which is convenient if you're often switching between your phone and computer. However, they may not be the best choice if you want a good microphone performance for phone calls since, compared to some of the cheaper options listed here, the mic makes your voice sound muffled and lacking in detail.

            Best Upper Mid-Range Over-Ear Headphones

        <h2>
            Bose QuietComfort 45/QC45 Wireless
        </h2>
        <p>
            If the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless are just outside your price range, you'll want to consider the Bose QuietComfort 45/QC45 Wireless. Although they aren't quite as feature-packed as their competitor, they have an excellent noise cancelling performance that easily blocks out sounds like plane engines and ambient chatter. With their ANC on, they also last over 21 hours continuously and are equipped with an auto-off timer to help conserve battery life if you forget to turn them off.

            Out of the box, their fairly neutral sound is versatile enough for most kinds of audio genres. You can tweak them to suit your tastes using their companion app's graphic EQ or presets. They also support multi-device pairing, meaning you can stay connected to your smartphone and PC at the same time. They have a plasticky design, which can seem a bit cheap at this price point. It helps them stay lightweight and comfortable enough for long listening sessions.

        <h2>
            Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless are a great mid-range pick for commuters. With an adaptive noise cancellation system that automatically adjusts the ANC to your surroundings, they easily block out other commuters' conversations and loud vehicle engines. Their plastic frame feels well-built and comfortable, though they have less padding in their headband than their predecessor, the Anker Soundcore Life Q35 Wireless, which may cause some fatigue during long listening sessions. While the manufacturer advertises them to last 50 hours continuously with their ANC on, we measured closer to 28 hours, which is still excellent for wireless noise cancelling headphones.

            Out of the box, these headphones have a v-shaped sound profile, with lots of thumpy bass and bright treble to make rock and pop music sound great. However, an underemphasized mid-range dulls instruments and vocals. If you want a different sound, their companion app has a graphic EQ and presets to fine-tune the profile to your liking. Unfortunately, these headphones have a high noise floor when the ANC is set to 'Adaptive' or 'Max' mode, which can result in an audible frequency that's persistent throughout your listening experience. It won't be an issue if you can tune it out by the sheer force of will. Otherwise, it can get annoying over time.

        <h2>
            Wyze Noise-Cancelling Headphones Wireless
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you're looking to spend under the triple-digit price point, look at the Wyze Noise-Cancelling Headphones Wireless. These over-ears have many of the features of more premium headphones, like ANC, but come in a much more affordable package. You may still hear some low bass from bus engines and wooshing trains during a commute, but you'll notice a significant reduction in ambient chatter in noisy offices. If you work somewhere quieter, like at home with a partner or roommates, they may hear your audio leaking at high volumes.

            Out of the box, these headphones have an excited, v-shaped sound profile. They have a touch of extra low bass, which will please fans of thumpy, rumbly hip-hop and EDM. The mid-range is well-balanced, so vocals and lead instruments sound present and clear, if not a little thin. However, the treble range is piercing and harsh, making sibilants like S and T sounds uncomfortable to listen to. If you want a different mix, their companion app has a graphic EQ and presets.

            The battery lasts nearly 23 hours on a single charge, which is excellent. However, they're bulky over-ear headphones. While they're comfortable, their size means they may slide around on smaller heads. If you're looking for slightly better ANC, check out the Anker Soundcore Life Q35 Wireless. They can cut out more low bass from background noise, meaning they're better suited for commuting and travel. Their sound profile also has more low bass, which some fans of thumpier music genres may prefer. Unfortunately, they're bulkier than the Wyze headphones, have worse consistency, and leaked more audio at high volumes.

            Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless are the previous generation of the Anker Soundcore Life Q35 Wireless. While their microphone performance isn't as good, and they don't support the LDAC codec for streaming hi-res audio, their design is mostly unchanged, meaning you can expect the same comfortable fit for a budget price. Their multi-setting ANC also performs better than the Q35 Wireless, blocking our more rumbly bus engine noise. They also support multi-device pairing for up to two devices at a time.

            These headphones have a v-shaped sound profile that packs extra bass while vocals and lead instruments are bright. You can tune their sound to suit your preferences using their companion app's graphic EQ and presets. Unfortunately, just like the previous generation, there's a difference in sound quality depending on if the ANC is on or off. They also aren't very breathable, and some users have also experienced the headband of their units break or crack over time. On the upside, these over-ears last for more than 44 hours of continuous use on a single charge and have a comfortable fit.
